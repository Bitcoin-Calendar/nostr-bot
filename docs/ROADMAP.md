# Bitcoin Calendar - Detailed Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Bitcoin Calendar project, organized by quarter with specific goals and milestones.

The goal of the Bitcoin Calendar project is to become a FOSS, self sovereign app with minimal to no dependency on third-party services. This will include storing historical events details, hosting an archive of all the webpages and a media server for all related media files, running Nostr relay to broadcast events, launching a website to display events and allow visitors to interact with them and spinning up a historian chatbot that will be able to communicate with Nostr users in plane English. We are at the very beginning of the journey:
